                            this is basically a ready platforming engine made in GameMaker, it is my bachelor's thesis project that was supposed to be a short game but
                            i couldn't keep up with the deadlines when fixing a lot of stuff in there, so i just turned in this as a base for <em>some</em> platformer (i passed :D)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <del>i guess i could polish things up a bit and publish it on itch or something as an example.</del> yeah as if i got time for this
                            i dont even use GameMaker anymore (i love <span style="color: #3d91ff">Godot</span>)
